In this chapter, we demonstrate Prusti's capabilities.
As a running example, we roughly follow the first chapters of the Rust tutorial
[Learn Rust with Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).
Linked lists turn out to be sufficiently complex that their implementation and verification covers most of Rust's and Prusti's essential concepts.
While the above tutorial explains in detail how linked lists are implemented in Rust, we additionally aim to verify that the implemented list operations are functionally correct.

While we assume basic familiarity with Rust, it is possible to learn both
Rust and Prusti at the same time by reading this tour and the 
[Rust tutorial](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/)
that inspired it in an interleaved fashion.
We will provide pointers to the Rust tutorial for beginners to catch up where appropriate.

Throughout this tour, we will cover the following Prusti concepts:

- How Prusti reports errors and integrates into the development process
- Runtime errors detected by Prusti
- Writing function-modular specifications 
- Using *pure* functions and predicates in specifications
- Writing loop invariants
- Using *extern_spec* to deal with library code
- Writing pledges for functions that return mutable references
- Basic troubleshooting


The individual chapters are found in the sidebar, which may be collapsed on mobile
devices.
As a quick reference, the main steps of this tour and the involved Prusti features
are as follows:

1. [Setup](setup.md): Adding Prusti to a Rust project
2. [Getting Started](getting-started.md): Simple runtime errors caught by Prusti
3. [New](new.md): Postconditions, pure functions
4. [Push](push.md): Preconditions, external specifications, trusted functions, old expressions, quantifiers, snapshots, structural/snapshot equality
5. [Pop](pop.md): Similar concepts as in [Push](push.md), predicates
6. [Testing](testing.md): Showing guarantees of verification vs running tests, and how to test specifications
7. [Option](option.md): Changing `Link` to use `Option` type
8. [Generics](generics.md): Prusti and generics
9. [Peek](peek.md): Verifying a `peek` function
10. [Pledges (mutable peek)](pledges.md): Demonstrating Prusti's pledges for functions returning mutable references
11. [Final Code](final.md): Final code for the verified linked list
12. [Loop Invariants](loop_invariants.md): Verifying code containing loops by writing loop invariants
13. [Counterexamples](counterexamples.md): Getting counterexamples for failing assertions
14. [`prusti-std` and External Specifications](extern_specs.md): Specifications for the Rust standard library, specifying external methods
