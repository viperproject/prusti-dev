    Rust tutorial: Hey it built! ...but this is actually a really foolish definition of a List

    Notation: [] = Stack () = Heap

    A list with three elements looks as follows:

        > [Elem A, ptr] -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Elem C, ptr) -> (Empty *junk*)

    - The last node is just overhead, the first node is not on the heap
    - Empty consumes space for a full pointer and an element

    This propagates e.g. when splitting off C:

        > [Elem A, ptr] -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Empty *junk*)
        > [Elem C, ptr] -> (Empty *junk*)

    We would rather like to have a Java/C-style pointer that is nullable:

        > [ptr] -> (Elem A, ptr) -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Elem C, *null*)

    Splitting off C then yields:

        > [ptr] -> (Elem A, ptr) -> (Elem B, *null*)
        > [ptr] -> (Elem C, *null*)

    Rust optimises the layout of enums such that the junk node (Empty) causes no overhead if the enum has the form

    > enum Foo {
    >    A,
    >    B(ContainsANonNullPtr),
    > }

    To profit from this null pointer optimisation, we thus move all data of a list node into a single C-style struct.
